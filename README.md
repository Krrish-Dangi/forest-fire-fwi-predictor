# 🔥 Forest Fire Weather Index (FWI) Prediction – First ML Project

This is my first Machine Learning project.

I learnt how to train multiple simple regression models such as:

* Simple Linear Regression
* Multiple Linear Regression
* Polynomial Regression
* Ridge Regression
* Lasso Regression
* ElasticNet Regression
* Performance evaluation of the model
* Cross Validation

From these, I selected the **Ridge Regression model** to predict the **Fire Weather Index (FWI)** based on environmental and weather-related data found in the **Algerian Forest Fires dataset**.

I trained the model, saved it, and then connected it to a very simple frontend built using **HTML and CSS**, with the backend handled by **Python Flask** to make the model interactive and usable.

This project helped me understand:

* End-to-end ML workflow
* Model training and comparison
* Regularization techniques
* Model deployment using Flask
* Connecting ML with a web interface

This is the first step in my journey into Machine Learning and real-world model deployment.
